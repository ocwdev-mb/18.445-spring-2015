description: Galton-Watson tree is a branching stochastic process arising from Fracis
  Galton's statistical investigation of the extinction of family names. The process
  models family names. Each vertex has a random number of offsprings. The figure shows
  the first four generations of a possible Galton-Watson tree. Image by Dr. Hao Wu.
